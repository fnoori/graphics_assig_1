How to use program:

-   Run the program using an IDE of your choice.
    *   I've created this project on my MacBook Pro (10.13.2) using XCode (9.2 (9C40b)), with OpenGL 4.1,
        So I am not 100% certain how it will run on the computers at the CPSC labs


-   Controls
    *   Press "A" to draw the initial square
        >   Press "Q" to add more squares/diamonds

    *   Press "S" to draw the initial spiral
        >   Press "W" to extend the spiral

    ## WARNING ## This does not work as intended
    *   Press "D" to draw the initial triangle
        ## THIS DOES NOT WORK ##
        >   Press "E" to begin the Sierpinski Triangle
